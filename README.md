# Elon Musk Tribute Webpage

This Tribute Webpage was the second project under FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification.
With the completion of this project, there is three projects left to go. 

Features:
In this project, instead of simply bulletpointing dates, I decided to go an extra step and implement a timeline, with the help of YouTube and online resources.
I was able to create a good looking timeline that allows for 22 events along the course of 40 years.

For every event, I listed a picture that allows a visual representation of these events to the end user. I felt this added more visibility and made it more engaging with the end user.

Learned:

I learned a great deal of HTML and CSS from this project.
Grouping from <div> and styling independent elements using an 'id'.
Centering images along with making a beginner header and footer section.
Learning how to create and style a timeline.
